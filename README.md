# Elasticstack Lab

This project will provide you an easy way to learn and play with elasticstack and in particular with logstash and filebeat configurations.

Project runs filebeat,logstash,elasticsearch and kibana. All with version ${ELASTIC_STACK_VERSION}. ELASTIC_STACK_VERSION can be defined in .env file.
